Keras - Better Entry Point for Deep Learning
--------------------------------------------

	Keras wraps powerful computational engines, such as Google's TensorFlow library, and allows you to create 
	sophisticated neural network models such as Multilayer Perceptrons, Convolutional Neural Networks and 
	Recurrent Neural Networks with just a few lines of code.
