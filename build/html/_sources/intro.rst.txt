Intro
=====

	I am learning AI (Artificial intelligence), ML (Machine learning), NN (neural network), DL (deep learning) ... 
	and thought it would be a good idea to keep what I have learnt in an easy to navigate document for future references.

	Initially, I will be moving fast without learning the nicer formatting, etc. 
	Once, the most contents are in, I will try to make the appearance more sophisticated.

	I will be migrating my code into python to take advantages of the auto doc generation power from the Sphinx.
