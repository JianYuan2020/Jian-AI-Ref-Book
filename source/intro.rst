I am learning AI (Artificial intelligence), ML (Machine learning), NN (neural network), DL (deep learning) ... and thought it would be a good idea to keep what I have learnt in an easy to navigate document for future references.

I will be migrating my code into python to take advantages of the auto doc generation power from the Sphinx.
