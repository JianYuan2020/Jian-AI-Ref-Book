Intro
=====

	I am learning AI (Artificial intelligence), ML (Machine learning), NN (neural network) / DL (deep learning) ... 
	and thought it would be a great idea to keep what I have learnt in an easy to navigate document for future references.

	Initially, I will be moving fast without perfecting in nicer formatting, etc. 
	Once, the most contents are in, I will try to make the appearance more pleasant.

	After all the study notes are in, I will add my Octave code snippets from all the projects I have done. 
	Then, I will migrate the code into python projects.

.. note:: Some of the "leafs" in the doc tree are place holder to remind me to fill-in the contents later. So only the top heading is correct - please ignore the rest.
