Machine Learning
================

.. note::

	A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some 
	performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

                                                               -- Tom Mitchell (1998)

For example:

* T: Classifying emails as spam or not spam.
* E: Watching you label emails as spam or not spam.
* P: The number (or fraction) of emails correctly classified as spam/not spam.

Supervised learning
-------------------

* Regression: Predict continuous valued output
* Classification: Discrete valued output (0 or 1)

Unsupervised learning
---------------------

* Clusters and Segmentation
