A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some 
performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

                                                               -- Tom Mitchell (1998)

* E: Watching you label emails as spam or not spam.
* P: The number (or fraction) of emails correctly classified as spam/not spam.
