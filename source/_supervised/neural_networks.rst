Neural Networks
===============
	* Origins: Algorithms that try to mimic the brain
	* Was very widely used in 80s and early 90s; popularity diminished in late 90s
	* Recent resurgence: State-of-the-art technique for many applications

Neural Networks: Representation
-------------------------------
	* Non-linear Hypotheses
	* Non-linear Classification
	* Computer Vision: Car detection

Neurons and the Brain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	The "one learning algorithm" hypothesis
