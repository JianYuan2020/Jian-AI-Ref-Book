# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.

# import sys

# -- Project information -----------------------------------------------------

# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.

# The theme to use for HTML and HTML Help pages.  See the documentation for
# a list of builtin themes.

# Add any paths that contain custom static files (such as style sheets) here,
# relative to this directory. They are copied after the builtin static files,
